## Epic Statement of Portfolio Project
At the end of the project, the website will be a portrayal of skills and abilities that I will bring to an employer as a junior developer.

### User Stories

As a developer I want my work to be showcased so that I can be hired as a designer/developer.

As an employer I want to be able to quickly assess the portfolio to determine if the candidate is right for the position.
